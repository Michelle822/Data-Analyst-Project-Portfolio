# Udacity_DataAnalyst
 This is a project work I did for the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**
 
 ## Project 1 - Global Weather Trends 
 In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global   temperatures
 
 
 ## Project 2 - Investigate a dataset - No Show Appointments

This project is based on the dataset which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row


## Project 3 - Analyze_A_B Test Analysis

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this  to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project 4 - Data Wrangling

The dataset that I had worked for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

**My goal:** Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

## Project 5 - Communicate data findings - Pisa dataset
The dataset that I used for this project was the PISA 2012 dataset. PISA, in particular, is a "survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school" (Udacity, 2019).
Within this datset we can find information for about 510,000 students. For each of these students, there are 636 answers which we can see in the columns. Of these, I decided to wrangle this dataset into a more manageable dataset of 15167 students with 19 columns.
In the second part, you will take your main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, you will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate your results. This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project. Select one or two major paths in your exploration, choose relevant visualizations along that path, and then polish them to construct a story for your readers to understand what you found.  
The project objective is not expected to explore all of the variables in the dataset! But focus on only exploration on about 10-15 of them.
