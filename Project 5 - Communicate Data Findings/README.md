### Data Analyst course - Project 5 - Communicate data findings

#### Skills to apply
1) Exploratory analysis

2) Explanatory analysis

### Project Description

The aim of this project is to, firstly, explore the dataset using exploratory analysis.  
Second, explanatory analysis needs to be conducted in order to document the possible story telling.   
The third and last part of the project consists of the creation of a slide deck.  
Chosen dataset: [PISA data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip&sa=D&ust=1554482573645000)  
The PISA database contains the full set of responses from individual students, school principals and parents. These files will be of use to statisticians and professional researchers who would like to undertake their own analysis of the PISA data.

## Summary of Findings

During the exploration 10 different questions were answered using the PISA data:

 1. Univariate exploration of the data
    1. What is the distribution of the scores for the different subjects among all the students  
    2. What is male/female ratio of the pisa dataset?  
    3. What is the distribution of the data collection of the students among the different countries?  
    4. Which countries host the most "high  scoring" students, what is the amount of students, with respect to each country and subject?  

2. Bivariate Exploration of the data
    5. What is the male/female ratio of the students the highstest enrolled countries in the pisa study?  
    6. How are males/females scoring for the 3 different subjects?   
    7. What are the mean scores for students from different countries for the 3 different subjects?     
    8. What is the gender distribution in the top 90,95,99th percentile of students?    


3. Multivariate Exploration of the data
    9. Are students who score high on one subject are likely to score high on another subject?  
    10. Does the highest degree of the parents have an influence on the mean scores of the student for the three individual subjects?

## Key Insights for Presentation

The following observations were made after exploration of the data corresponding to the 10 exploratory questions:
1. Observation: The distribution of the scores of mathematics, reading and science among all the students in the Pisa study are normally distributed.
2. Observation: The male/female ratio is almost equal in the pisa dataset.
3. Observation: The highest amount of students within the Pisa study in 2012 come from Mexico, followed by Italy, Spain and Canada.
4. Observation: The highest amount gifted students in mathematics are in China-Shanghai, followed by chinese Taipei and Singapore. The highest amount gifted students in reading are in Singapore, closely followed by Japan.
5. Observation: The male/female ratio seems to be equilibrated among the highest enrolled countries in the pisa study.
6. Observation: Math score tends to be higher for boys compared to girls in contrast to the reading score where girls seem to get an higher score. The science score seems to be evenly disributed for both boys and girls.
7. Observation: Highest means for 3 different subjects are observed in chinese countries. Students from Poland and Czech Republic seem to have high mean scores given they appear for the 3 different subjects in the top 15 of all countries.
8. Observation: The gender distribution is dependant on the subject. Both in science and mathematics, going towards a higher percentile, more boys achieved a higher scores whereas in reading, more girls obtained a higher score going to the higest percentile of scores.
9. Observation: There is a positive correlation between scores of different subject.
10. Observation: If either the mother or the father obtained no degree or the lowest degree (<ISCED level 1), lower mean scores are observed for the students in all 3 domains. No striking difference in mean scores of 3 subjects are observed between higher obtained degrees of either the mother or the father. There is however the tendency that higher educated parents have childeren with higher mean scores for all three subjects.
